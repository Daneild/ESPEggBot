# ESPEggBot

##### From EggBot website:
The [EggBot](https://egg-bot.com/) is a compact, easy to use open-source art robot that can draw on spherical or egg-shaped objects. Super adjustable; designed to draw on all kinds of things that are normally “impossible” to print on. Not just eggs but golf balls, light bulbs, mini pumpkins, and even things like wine glasses — with a bit of work.
